This Avalonia UI Neumorphic theme was inspired by another great Avalonia UI theme : [Material.Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/Material.Avalonia)

As neumorphism has no official specifications, this is my own personal interpretation of Neumorphism general guidelines i found on the web (mainly on [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/tags/neumorphism)).

It also uses some elements of Material Design such as :
- Primary and Secondary (Accent) color with light and dark variants
- A light theme and a dark theme (you can switch between them at runtime)
- Material Design Icons (must be installed separately)

For the moment only the following controls are fully themed :
- Buttons
- ToggleButtons
- RadioButtons
- Checkboxes
- Textboxes
- Comboboxes
- ProgressBars
- Sliders
- Cards

More controls should be themed soon.
